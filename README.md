## README Outline
Some questions that need to be answered as part of the repo:
1. Where is the data coming from?
2. What libraries do you use for this analysis? 
 - I would break this up into a couple of parts: 1) the actual analysis itself and 2) the visualization of the analysis
 - Provide a notebook for the analysis if there is one
3. A good general structure for the file system:
 - app (maybe where the viz files go)
 - data
 - notebooks 
 - any env files
 - pictures (if there are some from eda)
4. A good general structure for the README:
 - Abstract/Introduction
 - Methods Used/Vizualizations
 - Any Hypotheses
 - Conclusions
 - Future Work
